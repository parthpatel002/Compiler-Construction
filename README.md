# Compiler-Construction

This repo contains `C` code to implement a compiler for a custom programming language, for the partial fulfillment of the on-campus course Compiler Construction (CS F363). 

It was developed in two stages - `Stage_1_Submission` contains code developed till Stage 1, while `Stage_2_Submission` contains the final compiler code, integrating both the stages. The custom language specification is specified in `Language specifications.pdf`. 

The remaining file description is as follows:

1. `Final_LL1_Grammar.txt`: It contains the LL(1) grammar for the syntax of the custom language.
2. `support_grammar.pdf`: It contains analysis to convert grammar given in language specifications document to a LL(1) grammar.
3. `Stage_1_Milestones.txt`: It contains the list of compiler stages to be completed for stage 1 submission.

This work was done in a team of four, with my teammates being [Sankalp Sangle](https://github.com/sankalp-sangle), [Megh Thakkar](https://github.com/Megh-Thakkar) and [Sahil Singla](https://github.com/Sahil-Singla).
